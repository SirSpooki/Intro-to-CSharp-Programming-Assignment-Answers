Case Problems
------------------

--
In Chapter 4, you created an interactive application named GreenvilleRevenue that prompts a user for the number of contestants entered in this year’s and last year’s Greenville Idol competition and displays the revenue expected for this year’s competition if each contestant pays a $25 entrance fee. The program also displays one of three appropriate statements specified in the case problem in Chapter 4, based on a comparison between the number of contestants this year and last year. Now, modify the program so that the user must enter a number between 0 and 30, inclusive, for the number of contestants each year. If the user enters an incorrect number, the program prompts for a valid value.

In Chapter 4, you created an interactive application named MarshallsRevenue that prompts a user for the number of interior and exterior murals scheduled to be painted during a month and computes the expected revenue for each type of mural. The program also prompts the user for the month number and modifies the pricing based on requirements listed in Chapter 4. Now, modify the program so that the user must enter a month value from 1 through 12. If the user enters an incorrect number, the program prompts for a valid value. Also, the user must enter a number between 0 and 30 inclusive for the number of murals of each type; otherwise, the program prompts the user again.
