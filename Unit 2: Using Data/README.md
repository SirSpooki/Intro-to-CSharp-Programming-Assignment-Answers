In this chapter, you learned that although a double and a decimal both hold floating-point numbers, a double can hold a larger value. Write a C# program named DoubleDecimalTest that declares and displays two variables—a double and a decimal. Experiment by assigning the same constant value to each variable so that the assignment to the double is legal but the assignment to the decimal is not. In other words, when you leave the decimal assignment statement in the program, an error message should be generated that indicates the value is outside the range of the type decimal, but when you comment out the decimal assignment and its output statement, the program should compile correctly.

Write a C# program named InchesToCentmeters that declares a named constant that holds the number of centimeters in an inch: 2.54. Also declare a variable to represent a measurement in inches, and assign a value. Display the measurement in both inches and centimeters—for example, 3 inches is 7.62 centimeters.

2-3
--
Convert the InchesToCentimeters program to an interactive application named InchesToCentimeterslnteractive. Instead of assigning a value to the inches variable, accept the value from the user as input.

Write a C# program named ProjectedRaises that includes a named constant representing next year’s anticipated 4 percent raise for each employee in a company. Also declare variables to represent the current salaries for three employees. Assign values to the variables, and display, with explanatory text, next year’s salary for each employee.

2-5
--
Convert the ProjectedRaises class to an interactive application named ProjectedRaisesInteractive. Instead of assigning values to the salaries, accept them from the user as input.

Malcolm Movers charges a base rate of $200 per move plus $150 per hour and $2 per mile. Write a program named MoveEstimator that prompts a user for and accepts estimates for the number of hours for a job and the number of miles involved in the move and displays the total moving fee.

2-7
--
Write a program named HoursAndMinutes that declares a minutes variable to represent minutes worked on a job, and assign a value to it. Display the value in hours and minutes. For example, 197 minutes becomes 3 hours and 17 minutes.

2-8
--
Write a program named Eggs that declares four variables to hold the number of eggs produced in a month by each of four chickens, and assign a value to each variable. Sum the eggs, then display the total in dozens and eggs. For example, a total of 127 eggs is 10 dozen and 7 eggs.

2-9
--
Modify the Eggs program to create a new one named EggsInteractive that prompts the user for and accepts a number of eggs for each chicken.

2-10
--
Write a program named MakeChange that calculates and displays the conversion of an entered number of dollars into currency denominations—twenties, tens, fives, and ones. For example, $113 is 5 twenties, 1 ten, 0 fives, and 3 ones.

2-11
--
Write a program named TestsInteractive that prompts a user for eight test scores and displays the average of the test scores to two decimal places.

2-12
--
Write a program named FahrenheitToCelsius that accepts a temperature in Fahrenheit from a user and converts it to Celsius by subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit value and multiplying the result by 5/9. Display both values to one decimal place.

2-13
--
Create an enumeration named Month that holds values for the months of the year, starting with JANUARY equal to 1. Write a program named MonthNames that prompts the user for a month integer. Convert the user’s entry to a Month value, and display it.

2-14
--
Create an enumeration named Planet that holds the names for the eight planets in our solar system, starting with MERCURY and ending with NEPTUNE. Write a program named Planets that prompts the user for a numeric position, and display the name of the planet that is in the requested position.

2-15
--
Pig Latin is a nonsense language. To create a word in pig Latin, you remove the first letter and then add the first letter and “ay” at the end of the word. For example, “dog” becomes “ogday” and “cat” becomes “atcay.” Write a program named PigLatin that allows the user to enter a word and displays the pig Latin version.

In Chapter 1, you created two programs to display the motto for the Greenville Idol competition that is held each summer during the Greenville County Fair. Now write a program named GreenvilleRevenue that prompts a user for the number of contestants entered in last year’s competition and in this year’s competition. Display all the input data. Compute and display the revenue expected for this year’s competition if each contestant pays a $25 entrance fee. Also display a statement that indicates whether this year’s competition has more contestants than last year’s.

In Chapter 1, you created two programs to display the motto for Marshall’s Murals. Now write a program named MarshallsRevenue that prompts a user for the number of interior and exterior murals scheduled to be painted during the next month. Compute the expected revenue for each type of mural. Interior murals cost $500 each, and exterior murals cost $750 each. Also display the total expected revenue and a statement that indicates whether more interior murals are scheduled than exterior ones.
