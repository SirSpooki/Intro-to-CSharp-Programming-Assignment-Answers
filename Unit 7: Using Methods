# Exercise Instructions
7-1
--
Create a program named SalesLetter whose Main() method uses several WriteLine() calls to display a sales letter to prospective clients for a business of your choice. Display your contact information at least three times in the letter. The contact information should contain at least three lines with data such as land line phone number, cellphone number, email address, and so on. Each time you want to display the contact information, call a method named DisplayContactInfo().

Create a program named PaintingEstimate whose Main() method prompts a user for length and width of a room in feet. Create a method that accepts the values and then computes the cost of painting the room, assuming the room is rectangular and has four full walls and 9-foot ceilings. The price of the job is $6 per square foot. Return the price to the Main() method, and display it.

7-3
--
Create an application named ConvertMilesToKilometers whose Main() method prompts a user for a number of miles, passes the value to a method that converts the value to kilometers, and then returns the value to the Main() method where it is displayed. A mile is 1.60934 kilometers.

7-5
--
Create an application for a library and name it FineForOverdueBooks. The Main() method asks the user to input the number of books checked out and the number of days they are overdue. Pass those values to a method that displays the library fine, which is 10 cents per book per day for the first seven days a book is overdue, then 20 cents per book per day for each additional day.

7-6
--
In Chapter 4, you wrote a program named Admission for a college admissions office in which the user enters a numeric high school grade point average and an admission test score. The program displays Accept or Reject based on those values. Now, create a modified program named AdmissionModularized in which the grade point average and test score are passed to a method that returns a string containing Accept or Reject.

7-7
--
In Chapter 4, you wrote a program named Hurricane that classified hurricanes into five categories using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Now, create a modified version named HurricaneModularized that passes a user’s input wind speed to a method that returns the hurricane category.

7-8
--
Write a program named CountVowelsModularized that passes a string to a method that returns the number of vowels in the string.

7-9
--
Create a program named FlexibleArrayMethod that declares at least three integer arrays of different sizes. In turn, pass each array to a method that displays all the integers in each array and their sum.

# Case Problems
In Chapter 6, you continued to modify the GreenvilleRevenue program. Now, modify the program so that the major functions appear in the following individual methods:

- A method that gets and returns a valid number of contestants and is called twice—once for last year’s number of contestants and once for this year’s value

- A method that accepts the number of contestants this year and last year and displays one of the three messages that describes the relationship between the two contestant values

- A method that fills the array of competitors and their talent codes

- A method that continuously prompts for talent codes and displays contestants with the corresponding talent until a sentinel value is entered
---
In previous chapters, you continued to modify the MarshallsRevenue program. Now, modify the program so that the major functions appear in the following individual methods:

- A method that prompts for and returns the month

- A method that prompts for and returns the number of murals scheduled and is called twice—once for interior murals and once for exterior murals

- A method that accepts the number of interior and exterior murals scheduled, accepts the month they are scheduled, displays the interior and exterior prices, and then returns the total expected revenue

- A method that fills an array with customer names and mural codes and is called twice—once to fill the array of interior murals and once to fill the array of exterior murals

- A method that continuously prompts for mural codes and displays jobs of the corresponding type until a sentinel value is entered.
